# Project_13
# This project aims to develop a Python-based system that processes and analyzes EEG data generated from motor imagery tasks, with the goal of tracking and predicting stroke rehabilitation progress. By extracting and analyzing specific brainwave features, such as alpha and beta waves, the system will assess motor function recovery which will provide valuable insights into the patient’s rehabilitation progress. Based on this analyzed data, healthcare practitioners can tailor or customize the recovery program to each patient’s needs and will increase recovery outcomes!
